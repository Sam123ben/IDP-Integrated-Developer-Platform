# Environment Dashboard

This project is an Environment Dashboard built with multiple backend services (Go) and a frontend (React).

- **backend/services**: Each service (e.g., CompanyName and EnvironmentData) has its own folder with isolated files.
- **frontend**: Contains React-based frontend UI.

## Running the Project

2. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
