# Maintenance Page Project

## Overview

This project provides a **Maintenance Page System** designed to ensure smooth communication with customers during application upgrades or maintenance periods. The solution includes both a **customer-facing status page** and an **admin interface for SRE teams** to manage updates and system statuses efficiently.

## Features

### 1. **Customer-Facing Maintenance Page**
- A fully deployable maintenance page integrated with your application.
- Redirects customers to a **status page** during maintenance or upgrades.
- Displays:
  - Real-time **system status** of various services.
  - **Recent updates** about ongoing work.
  - **Estimated downtime** and any additional information about the application state.
- Provides an option to contact support with a displayed email address.

### 2. **SRE Admin Panel**
- Accessible interface for SRE engineers to:
  - Manage maintenance windows.
  - Update system status and recent updates dynamically.
- Updates are stored in the database and immediately reflected on the status page for customers.
- Includes fields like:
  - **Update Type**: Maintenance Window, Downtime Notice, etc.
  - **Start Time**: Scheduling the maintenance or downtime.
  - **Estimated Duration**: Time expected for resolution.
  - **Description**: Details of the issue or update.
  - **Issue Fixed**: A toggle to indicate whether the issue is resolved.

### 3. **Database Integration**
- Powered by **PostgreSQL** for robust and scalable data storage.
- Tracks:
  - System component statuses (e.g., API, Database, Cloudflare, etc.).
  - Historical updates for transparency and troubleshooting.
- Database can be deployed alongside the application.
- Provides an admin interface for SRE engineers to make seamless updates.
